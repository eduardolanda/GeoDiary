## GeoDiary using Mapbox and React .


### `What is it?`
This is an idea I had to create a diary and show the location where you had an experience and you wanted to register on your web app. 

### `Tech used for this project`
React.Js
MapBox
SemanticUI


### `Why did I use this tech?`
I worked before on projects using Google Maps and I wanted to test MapBox, highly recommend it, I think this has already won agains google maps. It brings more ways to interact on easier ways. 

### `SEMANTIC-UI`
Semantic UI is changing the way other libraries work, as bootstrap and material ui are doing. They have more ways to modify styling and even animation. 


### `Do you want to run this project?`

Just donwload the project and run in using yarn start or npm start, after being installed.
